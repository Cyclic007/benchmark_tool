Benchmarking tool for windows, uses a multicore load and stress spikes to test system performance.
Results can vary, but the tool is designed to give a general idea of how well a system can handle stress from some more common processes.
Results can vary from 1.5% between tests due to background programs.

Linux version is in development, but is not yet stable. We recommend using the windows version for now.
